# **Stock Recommendation System**

Welcome to the Stock Recommendation System project! This repository features an advanced recommendation system that analyzes multiple data sources to provide actionable insights for stocks, advising users on whether to Buy, Sell, or Hold a stock. Additionally, we offer a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline chatbot that assists users with basic stock market queries, helping them deepen their market knowledge.

**üìà Project Overview**

This stock recommendation system leverages various aspects of stock analysis, including:

1. Historical Stock Data: Analyzes stock price trends, volatility, and technical indicators to assess the stock‚Äôs recent performance.
2. Recent News Sentiment Analysis: Scans recent news related to the stock, calculating sentiment scores to understand market sentiment and possible trends.
3. Financial Statements: Evaluates key financial metrics from recent statements (like revenue, profit margins, and EPS) to assess the company's financial health and growth potential.
Based on this multi-aspect analysis, the system recommends whether the stock should be bought, sold, or held.

**üîç Stock Market Learning Assistant**

To aid users in learning about the stock market, we have implemented a chatbot based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. This chatbot allows users to ask questions about various stock market concepts, strategies, terms, and more.

**Key Features of the Chatbot:**

RAG-based Responses: Combines a retrieval system with a generation model to provide relevant and accurate answers.
